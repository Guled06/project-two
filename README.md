#### "Beer, happy Product of our Isle 
#### can sinewy Strength impart, 
#### And wearied with Fatigue and Toil can chear each manly heart.
#### Labour and Art upheld by Thee 
#### Successfully advance, 
#### We quaff Thy balmy Juice with Glee
#### And Water leave to France.
#### Genius of Health, thy grateful Taste
#### Rivals the Cup of Jove, 
#### And warms each English generous Breast
#### With Liberty and Love."

## Deployment

This app is configured for using GitHub with Travis CI for version control and CI. The project is ready for deployment on Heroku. A JawsDB instance must be provisioned for the Heroku app.

Add a `SERVER_SECRET` to the Heroku config for the app. (See [Configuration and Config Vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) to learn how.)

## Running Locally

- Update username, password, and database fields in `/config/config.json` for local MySQL server connection.
- Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project. The file must include the following:
  ```
  SERVER_SECRET = <your_secret_for_session_signing>
  ```
- Run `npm run watch` to start development server using nodemon.
