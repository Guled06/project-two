                                Something amazing is brewing throughout San Diego. The
                                region's craft/micro/nano breweries are turning out innovative
                                beers, including the West Coast IPA (a local twist on the
                                IPA), that have been pushing the envelope and sweeping award
                                ceremonies at national and international contests.

                                As Covid regulations begin to lift around California, both
                                natives and tourists of San Diego will be looking to wet their
                                beaks at the local watering hole, perhaps more than ever. Our
                                app takes that into account and provides a navigable user
                                interface to wade through the trove of local brewery
                                selections. Search our map for your favorite brewery, find a
                                new spot with our County Favorites list, or (coming soon!)
                                browse our community to link up with some San Diego “brew
                                budz”!
