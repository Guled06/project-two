                                    Something amazing is brewing throughout San Diego. The
                                                      region's craft/micro/nano breweries are turning out innovative
                                                      beers, including the West Coast IPA (a local twist on the
                                                      IPA), that have been pushing the envelope and sweeping award
                                                      ceremonies at national and international contests.

                                    As Covid regulations begin to lift around California, both
                                                      natives and tourists of San Diego will be looking to wet their
                                                      beaks at the local watering hole, perhaps more than ever. Our
                                                      app takes that into account and provides a navigable user
